## Introduction

This document contains a summary of the creation of a movie recommendation algorithm developed in R.
It uses a comprehensive database of 10 million entries, gathering thousands of users and movies.
I'll provide you first with the database summary statistics, then with the machine learning design, before finally moving to the outcomes of my work. 

## Database

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
