Movie recommandation algorithm

# Important note: this is a non-comprehensive and non-definitive work. It was left as it is in view of respecting course deadlines and other profesionnal comitments.

# Overview
This project is the first of two captsones for the completion of the Data Science Professionnal Certificate offered by HarvardX on the Edx.org platform.

The purpose of the R script is to train an algorithm to predict the rating given to a specific movie by a specific user, and recommend the former to the latter.

# Summary and improvements
This is the first complete and conclusive draft written. The model presents an RMSE obtaining the best grading-score possible for the course. 
However, many improvements can be done in terms of organizing the code and refining the prediction strategies.

See the PDF report for the detailed method.
